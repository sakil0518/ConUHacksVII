## Website - RabbitBlackExicted23! 📝 

<img src = "img/pic.png">


<h3>💡Concepts💡</h3>
- This website is a generating strong secure password for user. The generated password is long enough but easy to remember. 

<h3>🎯Our solution🎯</h3>
- 

<br>

<h4>Inspiration</h4>
- Our team wants to create a website for students to help them to have better GPAs but less pressure for their university life.

<h4>Challenges we ran into</h4>
- We want to make the strong password for user, but the password must be long to be secure. However, user will have a hard time to remember the password if it is too long. So, we need to think the easier way to memorize when we create comnbination of the the letters, digits, and special characters. 

<h4>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h4>
- 

<h4>What we learned</h4> 
- We learned how to work with the team and communicate with each other. Also, we learned how to think and use the skills need to be used to build a website. 

<h4>What's next for RabbitBlackExicted23!</h4>
- The majority of work we did in the hackathon is front-end based, and we could not implement back-end work like saving students' information to the database because we ran out of time. So, We need to work on the database and also need think about how can we effectively save the passw to students to make them study harder.

## 2. Challenge Question - Pain Points for Carriers 🚚 <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white">

<img src = "123Loadboard_Challenge/Quality_Driver_Background.png">
This is the Challenge Question from 123LoadBoard as part of the 12th Edition of McGill CodeJam.

<h3>Challenge</h3>
- Staying Awake while Driving 💤 ⚡ Problem Carriers drive large trucks for several hours straight, and if they are not well rested, they can experience fatigue and sleepiness on the road. Drowsiness while driving is hazardous for carriers and surrounding drivers. Keeping carriers awake and alert could save lives.

<h3>💡Concepts💡</h3>
- A carrier is a trucker that moves loads of merchandise from point A to point B. A broker posts loads they need delivered on load boards to try to get their loads hauled by a carrier. A pain point is a common issue or problem faced by carriers and brokers that makes their jobs more difficult.

<h3>🎯Our solution🎯</h3>
- This algorithm monitors the change in speed and acceleration and checks if the driver is being reckless, breaking too hard or even dozing off. ## How we built it We built this algorithm using Visual Studio Code as our IDE and Python as our programming language. 

<h4>Inspiration</h4>
- Does your drivers ever find themself dowsing off while driving long distance? Sweat no more, this algorithm can save the day. By monitoring change in speed, it can alert drivers by rewarding good driver and penalizing bad drivers. Sometimes driving long distances can be boring. A system that monitors and rewards good driving can increase driving quality. 

<h4>Challenges we ran into</h4>
- The challenge we ran into was to generate variation in speed and acceleration in the most natural way possible. 

<h4>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h4>
- The algorithm can check for four different states; A good driver, a dangerous driver, a driver breaking too hard or a driver dozing off. 

<h4>What we learned</h4> 
- We learned how to work efficiently as a team and how to use GitHub to commit, push and pull code from a repository. 

<h4>What's next for Quality Driver</h4>
- 123loadboard Improve driving quality with real-world data and implement a reward/reputation system to incentivize better driving.
